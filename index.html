<h2>Problem statement: [title]</h2>

<p>

[Adolescents often lack guidance in self-administering common over-the-counter medications like Tylenol and Advil, relying on parental advice through phone calls. 
  To foster independence and ensure safe self-care practices, there is a need for an Over-the-Counter Medication App. 
  This app will enable adolescents to input symptoms, receive personalized medication suggestions, and receive reminders for timely doses, promoting responsible medication management among the youth.
